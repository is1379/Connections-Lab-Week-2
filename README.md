# Connections Lab Week 2

Hi everyone 👋🏼

This is a submission for Week 2 of IMA Low Res @ NYU (Fall 2022). It's a work in progress for Midterm Project 1 for the Connections Lab class. The core idea is a "Billionaire Loader" which loads a billionaire's wealth and compares that to the wealth of the average American. This projet could easily be expanded to include more billionaires (I have chosen only the top 10) and comparisons to average persons in other countries.

Enjoy 😊
